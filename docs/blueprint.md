# **App Name**: Aura

## Core Features:

- Energy Predictor: Train an AI tool to predict the energy consumption of different AI models based on their architecture and input data size. Show a graph's like bar chart, pie chart, histogram etc
- Model Optimizer: Analyze a given model and suggest techniques such as pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation to reduce its size while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
- Energy Display: Show predicted or measured energy consumption metrics (e.g., Watts, CO2 emissions) in an easily understandable format, so the user can easily visualize the energy optimization results.
- Model Selection: Provide a way to select an AI model from different frameworks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#4CAF50) to represent energy efficiency and sustainability.
- Secondary colors: Light green (#80E275) and a neutral grey (#E0E0E0).
- Accent: Yellow (#FFEB3B) to highlight key information and actionable items.
- Use Poppins fonts for readability in data visualization.
- Use icons related to energy to represent different models and metrics.
- Clean, data-focused layout to prioritize information about energy usage and model performance.
- Dark colors in background to reduce eye strain and improve contrast.
