Aura-AI-Energy Efficiency Optimization

This is an app that i have found for the Energy Efficiency Optimization

Problem Statement:
AI systems, especially a large-scale deep learning models, consumes significant amounts of energy during training and inference. This rising energy demand contributes to higher operational costs and increased environmental impact. There is a critical need to develop methods that optimize AI models and infrastructure for greater energy efficiency, without sacrificing accuracy, speed or reliability. The challenge lies in balancing computational performance with sustainable energy consumption across model design, training, deployment and maintenance phases.

The solution that i have created for this is Aura.

Aura is our AI Energy Efficiency Companion. It helps you understand and optimize the energy consumption of your AI models. Use the navigation menu or click the cards below to explore features like Energy Prediction, Model Optimization, Training Simulations, and more.

1.Energy Prediction
This is a feature in my app that helps the user to predict the energy consumption of the users AI model

2.Model Optimizer

This is a feature in my app that helps the user to receive the optimization suggestions of the AI models they are going to use it

3.Aura Chat

This feature helps the user to get suggestions about the AI models energy optimization tips(this was under development)

4.Saving tips: 

This is just a page that shows all the energy saving tips to reduce our AI's energy foot print

5.Model Comparision

This feature in Aura helps the user to compare and give the proper report of the AI model in graph or any other type of visuals.

6.Report generator

This feature helps the user to generate the report for before vs after AI comparision 

7.Training Simulation

This feature helps to simulate a PyTorch model training process including pruning and energy logging. This demonstrates conceptual steps and does not perform actual GPU/CPU intensive training.
